# SQL Injection Demo

An insecure application to demo SQL injection.

## Usage

**DISCLAIMER: Do NOT attempt SQL Injection Attacks on any application if you do not have permission. IT IS A FELONY.**

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ts-cset/sql-injection-demo.git
$ cd sql-injection-demo
$ sh run.sh
```

Now you can open the app and try out a SQL Injection Attack at http://localhost:5000 . See if you can append user names and passwords to the end of the search results table. To get the best practice, try this without looking at any of the application code, just like a real attacker.
